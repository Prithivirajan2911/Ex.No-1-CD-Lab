Ex-5-RECOGNITION-OF-THE-GRAMMAR-anb-where-n-10-USING-YACC
RECOGNITION OF THE GRAMMAR(anb where n>=10) USING YACC

Date:
Aim:
To write a YACC program to recognize the grammar anb where n>=10.

ALGORITHM
Start the program.
Write a program in the vi editor and save it with .l extension.
In the lex program, write the translation rules for the variables a and b.
Write a program in the vi editor and save it with .y extension.
Compile the lex program with lex compiler to produce output file as lex.yy.c. eg $ lex filename.l
Compile the yacc program with yacc compiler to produce output file as y.tab.c. eg $ yacc â€“d arith_id.y
Compile these with the C compiler as gcc lex.yy.c y.tab.c
Enter a string as input and it is identified as valid or invalid.

OUTPUT
RESULT
The YACC program to recognize the grammar anb where n>=10 is executed successfully and the output is verified.
